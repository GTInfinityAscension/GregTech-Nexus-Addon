## Notes

### Same-author project

The iterative AE2 crafting planner in GTNA was adapted from **RaishxCore**, another mod by the
GTNA author, from AE2 1.21.1 to AE2 1.20.1. RaishxCore declares LGPL-3.0-or-later. The Nexus ME
Hypercore multiblock itself is original to GTNA and has no source attribution in its tooltip.

### GregTech Odyssey (GTO)

- The GTO team confirmed that **original code** (`src/main/java` of GTOCore) is **LGPLv3**, while
  **original textures/assets are CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** and must stay under that license.
- GTO also asked that ported content **credit the original addon in tooltips** (as GTNH and GTO do
  between themselves). GTNA implements this through `GTNASources`.
- The Fishing Ground's compressed `pattern/gto/fishing_ground.mbs` and the Aluminium Bronze /
  Stainless Evaporation casing textures come from GTOCore. The Generator Array, Fishing Ground and
  Evaporation Plant behavior, structures and recipes are adapted from GTOCore source at commit
  `dc4824d`.
- The Greenhouse's compressed `pattern/gto/greenhouse.mbs`, light behavior, controller recipe and
  crop recipes are adapted from the same GTOCore commit. Its nine Rich Soil positions also accept
  vanilla Mud, allowing the structure to work without Farmer's Delight installed.
- The Component Assembler's base structure, tier matching, and LV–IV component batch recipes are
  adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`. Its LV–IV casing and Multi Functional Casing textures
  (including the connected texture sheet) are from GTOCore and retain CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution.
- The Component Assembler's large extension (both `addSubPattern` layers of
  `MultiBlockC.java:328-397`), the LuV–UV batch family, the extension casing production and the
  extension's tier cap are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`. The `THREE_PROOF_COMPUTER_CASING`,
  `MACHINING_CONTROL_CASING_MK2`, `ENERGY_CONTROL_CASING_MK2`, `ELECTRIC_POWER_TRANSMISSION_CASING`
  and `TITANIUM_NITRIDE_CERAMIC_IMPACT_RESISTANT_MECHANICAL_BLOCK` textures (with their connected
  texture sheets and `.png.mcmeta`; the two MK2 control casings are sided) and the LuV–UV casing
  textures are from GTOCore and retain CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution. The `CarbonFiberPolyphenyleneSulfideComposite`
  and `TitaniumNitrideCeramic` material definitions are copied 1:1 (minus GTO-only flags). GTOCore's
  MK2 control-casing recipes are Precision Assembler recipes of an excluded machine, so GTNA adds
  documented alternative Assembler routes.
- The `component_assembly_line`'s compressed `pattern/gto/component_assembly_line.mbs`, uniform tier
  rule and LuV–UV batch gating are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`. The
  `component_assembly_line_casing_lv..uv` and `iridium_casing` textures (with their connected sheets
  and `.png.mcmeta`) are from GTOCore and retain CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution; the UHV–MAX casings are
  out of scope. GTOCore's nine GTO-only structure casings and its cross-recipe execution are
  substituted by documented GTNA/GTCEu equivalents (see the ledger G-0110 table); the iridium casing
  is ported from GTO with its Assembly Line recipe (GTO's Tanmolyium plate copied 1:1), and the
  controller recipe is omitted because it needs the GTO-only Advanced Assembly Line chain. The ZPM/UV
  casing recipes substitute GTO's Pikyonium/ArtheriumTin/AbyssalAlloy solders with obtainable
  GTNA/GTCEu equivalents (ledger G-0114).
- G-0204 mega multiblocks: the compressed `pattern/gto/{large_pyrolyse_oven,cracker_hub,mega_brewer,
  mega_vacuum_drying_furnace,giant_flotation_tank}.mbs` structures, block mappings and controller recipes are
  adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`; GTO-only recipe inputs are substituted (see
  `GTNAMegaMachineRecipes`). The `oil_gas_transportation_pipe_casing`,
  `calcium_oxide_ceramic_anti_metal_corrosion_mechanical_block` and `stabilized_naquadah_water_plant_casing`
  textures (with connected sheets and `.png.mcmeta`) are from GTOCore and retain CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution.
- G-0205: `phase_change_cube`, `engraving_laser_plant` and `infinity_fluid_drilling_rig` (structures, behavior and
  recipes) are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`; `amprosium_active_casing` and `amprosium_gearbox` use GTOCore's
  `neutronium_active_casing` / `neutronium_gearbox` textures (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). The `mega_distillery` structure is
  converted from GTLCore's `MultiBlockMachineAStructureC.MEGA_DISTILLERY`, and its recipe comes from the GregTech Leisure
  1.4.5.1 KubeJS scripts.
- G-0206: `super_blast_smelter`, `large_cracker` and `integrated_assembler`
  (structures, behavior and recipes) are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`.
- G-0207: `neutronium_wire_cutting`, `holy_separator`, `superconducting_electromagnetism`
  and `superconducting_magnetic_presser` (structures, behavior and recipes) are adapted from GTOCore at commit
  `dc4824d`. The `high_pressure_resistant_casing`, `mc_nylon_tensile_mechanical_shell`, `lafium_mechanical_casing`
  and `amprosium_borosilicate_glass` (GTO `neutronium_borosilicate_glass`) textures and the `multiblock/general0`
  overlay are from GTOCore and retain CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution.
- G-0209: `magnetic_energy_reaction_furnace` and `particle_stream_matrix_filling_machine`
  (structures, behavior and recipes) are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`. The
  `transcendentally_amplified_magnetic_confinement_casing` and `speeding_pipe` textures and the `multiblock/general1` overlay are from GTOCore (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
- G-0210: `nanites_circuit_assembly_factory`, `mega_wiremill` and `crystal_builder` (structures, behavior and recipes)
  are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`; the `hyper_core` (with bloom), `pikyonium_machine_casing`,
  `high_strength_support_spindle` and `quantum_glass` textures are from GTOCore (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
- G-0243: `high_energy_laser_lathe` and `extreme_compressor` (structures, behavior and recipes) are adapted from
  GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`; the `iridium_pipe_casing` (GTO `machine_casing_pipe_iridium`), `iridium_gearbox` (GTO
  `machine_casing_gearbox_iridium`), `laser_cooling_casing` and `high_energy_laser_emitter` textures are from GTOCore
  (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
- G-0244: `hyperdimensional_plasma_fusion_core`, `gemini_containment_system` and `giant_electrochemical_workstation`
  (structures, behavior and recipes) are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`; the `sps_casing`,
  `space_elevator_mechanical_casing`, `engineering_mechanical_casing`, `peek_wear_resistant_mechanical_housing` and
  `industrial_frameless_glass` textures are from GTOCore (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
- G-0245: `desulfurizer`, `dimensional_focus_engraving_array`, `star_ultimate_material_forge_factory`,
  `hand_of_arachne`, `rare_earth_centrifugal` and `heavy_rolling` (structures, behavior, recipe types and recipes) are
  adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`; the `smelting_control_casing`, `stable_base_casing`,
  `insulation_tile_mechanical_block`, `hsss_borosilicate_glass`, `ultimate_stellar_containment_casing` (GTO
  `stellar_containment_casing`) and `amprosium_casing` (GTO `neutronium_casing`) textures are from GTOCore
  (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
- G-0246: `lightning_rod`, `pcb_factory`, `space_probe_surface_reception` and `compound_extreme_cooling_unit`
  (structures, behavior, recipe types and recipes) are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`; `GTNAGTORecipes`
  (generated by `tools/port_gto_recipes.py`) and `GTNAGTOPatterns` (`tools/extract_gto_inline_patterns.py`) copy
  GTOCore recipes and inline patterns; the `gravity_stabilization_casing`, `pps_corrosion_resistant_mechanical_housing`,
  `plasma_heater_casing` and `high_energy_ultraviolet_emitter_casing` textures are from GTOCore (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
- G-0247: `hyper_reactor` and `advanced_hyper_reactor` (structures, behavior and recipe types) are adapted from
  GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`; the `enhance_hyper_mechanical_casing` and `echo_casing` textures are from GTOCore
  (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
- G-0248: `fuel_cell_generator` (structure, behavior, recipe types and recipes), the four electrolyte fluid states,
  the redox-flow electrolytes, the membrane materials and the membrane electrode prefix are adapted from GTOCore at
  commit `dc4824d`; the `flocculation_casing` texture and the `membrane_electrode` material-set icons are from GTOCore
  (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
- G-0249: `supercomputing_center`, the NICH/GWCA HPCA components, the `thermal_conductor_hatch` and the MFPC
  materials are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`; the `about_computer` textures (computer casings, vents and
  component overlays), the `tungsten_borosilicate_glass` / `taranium_borosilicate_glass` textures and the
  `overlay_neutron_sensor` hatch overlay are from GTOCore (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).
- G-0250: `data_center` and `analysis_and_research_center` (structures, behavior and recipe types) are adapted from
  GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`.
- The Blaze and Cold Ice two-layer casings, including the emissive `_bloom` overlays and their
  connected sheets and animation metadata, and the MK2 control casings' `side_bloom` overlays are from GTOCore and retain
  CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution. `naquadah_alloy_casing` reuses the GTO `hyper_mechanical_casing` sheet
  (the earlier GTNA copy used the water-purification sheet by mistake).
- The Grinding Ball Hatch's `ball_hatch_idle` and `ball_hatch_spinning` rotor sprites and animation
  metadata are copied from GTOCore under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0; the renderer is reimplemented for GTCEu 7.5.3.
- The Large Greenhouse's compressed structure, dual greenhouse/tree recipe modes, controller recipe,
  and tree growth family are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`.
- The Blaze Blast Furnace's compressed structure, molten Blaze upkeep and controller recipe are
  adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`. Its Blaze Casing texture and connected texture sheet
  retain the original CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 asset license. GTNA crafts that casing in the Large Chemical
  Reactor with the same inputs because the original Reaction Furnace is excluded from this port.
- The Cold Ice Freezer's base structure, liquid Ice upkeep, casing/controller recipes and Cold Ice
  Casing texture (including its connected texture sheet) are adapted from GTOCore at commit
  `dc4824d`. The textures retain CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution.
- The Chemical Plant's compressed `pattern/gto/chemical_plant.mbs`, structure, coil efficiency
  behavior and controller recipe are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`. GTO applies its
  coil bonus through the closed-source gtolib `coilReductionOverclock`; GTNA reproduces the
  behavior the controller displays (5% EU and duration reduction per coil tier plus a perfect
  overclock). The controller reuses GTCEu's Large Chemical Reactor front overlay, which shares the
  same inert-PTFE casing.
- The Mega Alloy Blast Smelter's structure, 0.8× EU / 0.6× duration bonus and Parallel Hatch are
  adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`. It reuses GTCEu's GCYM casings and `ALLOY_BLAST_RECIPES`.
  GTO's tiered integral-framework cell and GCYM ability predicate are substituted by a TungstenSteel
  frame and the standard auto abilities because GTNA does not port that tier-block system.
- The ISA Mill's compressed `pattern/gto/isa_mill.mbs`, perfect overclock, grinding-ball gate and
  durability formula, the 48 wet-grinding recipes, the Inconel-625 casing/gearbox/pipe recipes, the
  two grinding-ball Forming Press recipes, the Grinding Ball Hatch and the Assembly Line controller
  recipe are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`. Its Inconel-625 casing, gearbox, pipe and
  `ball_hatch` overlay textures, the two grinding-ball item textures and the `milled` material item
  texture/model are from GTOCore and retain CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution. The Inconel-625, Inconel-792
  and Tantalloy-61 material definitions are copied from GTO's `MaterialA` so those recipes stay
  faithful; GTCEu's automatic alloy-blast/EBF/mixer generation produces them.
- GTOCore itself includes textures from other mods; see
  [GTO's `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md`](https://github.com/GregTech-Odyssey/GregTech-Odyssey/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md).
- The Rocket Large Turbine's structure and non-mega `TurbineMachine` behavior (base
  `V[EV] * 2.5` output, rotor speed/voltage math, high-speed mode and the rocket engine module
  bonus) are adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`. It reuses GTCEu's titanium casings, gearbox,
  rotor holder, rotors and `RocketFuel`, so no GTO casing is copied. Its high-speed-mode GUI toggle
  texture (`gui/overlay/high_speed_mode.png`) is from GTOCore and retains CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
  attribution.
- The EV, IV and LuV Rocket Engine generator textures and their shaped crafting recipes are adapted
  from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`. GTNA uses GTCEu's `SimpleGeneratorMachine` implementation and
  the already ported Rocket Fuel recipe; the cable ingredients refer to GTCEu's cable blocks.
  The generator textures retain CC BY-NC-SA 4.0
  attribution.
- The Component Assembly Line's Molecular, Boron Carbide, Precision Processing, Advanced Assembly
  Line, Chemical Corrosion Resistant Pipe, Circuit Assembly Line, Spacetime Assembly Line and
  Pressure Containment casing textures, connected sheets and animation metadata are from GTOCore
  at commit `dc4824d` and retain CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution. Their structure positions follow
  GTOCore. Crafting inputs that require GTO-only materials or production machines are adapted to
  GTNA/GTCEu materials in `GTNABlockRecipes`. The Component Assembly recipe layout
  (`ui/recipe_type/component_assembly.rtui`) is copied from GTOCore under GTNA's namespace; its
  two Component Assembly Line progress bar textures are copied under `assets/gtceu` because the
  original binary layout references those resource paths.
- The Supercritical Steam Turbine's structure and non-mega `TurbineMachine` behavior (base
  `V[IV] * 2` output, rotor speed/voltage math, high-speed mode and the supercritical module bonus),
  its controller and casing Assembler recipes and its fuel recipe are adapted from GTOCore at commit
  `dc4824d`. GTNA substitutes its own `DenseSupercriticalSteam` for GTO's `SupercriticalSteam` in
  the fuel recipe (same 80 mB → 8 mB distilled water / 30 ticks / `V[MV]` numbers). Its
  `supercritical_turbine_casing` texture, connected texture sheet and `.png.mcmeta` are from
  GTOCore and retain CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution.
- The Industrial Flotation Cell and Vacuum Drying Furnace pair (structure, machine behavior, recipe
  types and recipes) is adapted from GTOCore at commit `dc4824d`
  (`MultiBlockA.java:1678`/`:1707`, `pattern/industrial_flotation_cell.mbs`,
  `pattern/vacuum_drying_furnace.mbs`, `classified/FlotatingBeneficiation.java`,
  `classified/VacuumDrying.java`, `classified/Dehydrator.java`, the casing recipes of
  `classified/Assembler.java`, the flotation controller of `classified/AssemblyLine.java` and the
  red-mud neutralisation of `processing/StoneDustProcess.java`). The `hastelloy_n_75_casing`,
  `hastelloy_n_75_gearbox`, `hastelloy_n_75_pipe`, `flotation_cell` and `red_steel_casing`
  textures (with their connected texture sheets and `.png.mcmeta`) are from GTOCore and retain
  CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution. The Hastelloy-N75 and Stellite material definitions are copied 1:1
  from GTO's `MaterialA` so the casing and controller recipes stay faithful; GTCEu's automatic
  alloy-blast/EBF/mixer generation produces them.
- The IV Dehydrator machine and the Vacuum Drying Furnace's original controller recipe are adapted
  from GTOCore `GTOMachines.java`, `MachineRecipe.java` and `classified/Assembler.java` at commit
  `dc4824d`. The six Dehydrator overlay textures are copied from GTOCore and retain CC BY-NC-SA
  4.0 attribution.

### GT: Not Leisure (GTNL)

- The GTNL author granted permission to use GTNL structures with source attribution.
- The same permission covers GTNL's own per-machine controller overlay textures, ported under
  `assets/gtna/textures/block/multiblock/*` (from GTNL `textures/blocks/iconsets/*`).
- Structures that GTNL itself ported from GTO are credited to **GTO**, whose assets are used under
  **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** (permission confirmed by the GTO team).
- **Steam Elevator overlay:** GTNL renders the elevator front with `gregtech:iconsets/EM_COMPUTER`
  (`BlockIcons.OVERLAY_FRONT_TECTECH_MULTIBLOCK`), a **GT5U/Tectech** icon that GTNL references from
  GregTech's resource domain but does **not** vendor in its own repository. Since the GTNL repo has
  no elevator overlay to port, GTNA uses the same icon as retextured by the Modernity-GTNH pack
  (already a source of this project) under `assets/gtna/textures/block/multiblock/steam_elevator/`.

### Attribution in tooltips

GTNA appends a `Source: <addon>` line to the tooltips of ported machines/items. The mapping lives in
`src/main/java/com/raishxn/gtna/common/data/GTNASources.java`.

### Void Miner essence chain (2026-09-29)

The 40 vein compositions and seed/incubation mechanics were verified against the author's
local Prism instance `GregTech-Leisure-1.4.5.1`, `kubejs/server_scripts/gtceu.js:6255–6729`.
The GTNA implementation is native Java, with explicitly adapted EV costs, Raw Ore outputs,
stock-material substitutions and five base Ad Astra planet programs. The 5×5×5 Incubator
structure and scanner recipe map/tank capacity follow GTLCore `gtl-1431-skyblock`, commit
`18c7814`; machine tooltips credit GregTech Leisure through `GTNASources`.

Essence/Essence Seed icons, vein icons in `assets/gtna/textures/item/essence/`, and the
World Data Scanner overlay come from the local GTOCore checkout under
`src/main/resources/assets/gtocore/textures/{item,block/machines/world_data_scanner}`.
They retain **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**, the original asset license confirmed by the GTO team above.
World-specific vein variants reuse GTO's corresponding generic icon. Planet essence items
reuse the GTO Essence icon. No assets from the pack's unconfirmed asset license were copied.

### Discovered-fluid drilling (2026-09-29)

The Void Fluid Drilling Rig tower follows GTLCore's 3×7×3 drilling pattern
(`MultiBlockMachineAStructureA.java`, local `gtl-1431-skyblock` reference). GTNA uses
Titanium/Steel materials and new native discovery certificates, configurable recipes and
remote-production gates. GTL's terrestrial fluid proportions informed the prototype, with
explicitly reduced production rates and added reagents. Machine tooltips credit GTL.
No GTL/GTO textures were copied for this system: models reference existing GTCEu casing,
drilling-rig, scanner, Data Stick, Data Orb and fluid-filter resources.
The optional GTIA Mars deposit example uses the numeric reference in GTOCore's
`GTOBedrockFluids.java`; it is pack-owned data, not default GTNA world generation.

## Eye of Harmony content foundation (2026-10-04)

The 27 tiered field blocks, three structural casings, three Planet Blocks and Astral Array
Fabricator are new physical components. Existing machine behavior and published casing IDs
are preserved in this foundation stage. No external source code was copied verbatim.

- **GTNH / GT5-Unofficial**, revision `a3e1e11241a814c9fa0dd0973d5699548428f689`:
  field identity, tier names, casing roles and Astral Array reference. Original field textures
  missing from Modernity, plus the original Astral Array sprite/animation and other fallbacks,
  retain the repository's LGPLv3 license. Source: [GT5U](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GT5-Unofficial/tree/a3e1e11241a814c9fa0dd0973d5699548428f689).
  `EyeOfHarmonyMath.java` adapts the serial duration, startup/return energy, gas overflow,
  chance, yield, failure fluid and pity rules from `MTEEyeOfHarmony.java`,
  `EyeOfHarmonyRecipe.java` and `EyeOfHarmonyRecipeStorage.java`. This adaptation retains
  LGPL-3.0 attribution; it isolates pure calculations, uses immutable plans and an explicit
  supplied roll, and leaves the modern ore/plasma catalog and world transactions separate.
  `EyeOfHarmonyCatalog.java` (formerly `EyeOfHarmonyOverworld.java`) also adapts `processDimension`, `processHelper`, dust/plasma
  eligibility and plasma-energy calculation from `EyeOfHarmonyRecipe.java`. Modern GTCEu
  ore definitions, OreProperty values and loaded plasma fuel recipes replace the legacy wrappers;
  differences and the retained 2.25 normal-vein flow are documented in the operation audit.
  The controller implements GTNA-specific persisted transactions and bounded pending delivery.
- **Modernity-GTNH**: corresponding field, casing, controller overlay and Planet Block textures
  are used where available. Their PNG/animation bytes are unchanged; resource paths were relocated
  into the GTNA namespace. These assets retain **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**, as declared by the source
  repository. This is licensed reuse, not a claim of an individually granted permission.
- **GTNH NEI Ore Plugin**: Planet Block dimension identity and six-face naming convention are
  referenced from revision `2ccf8c43d8d25b10239f5bcc48e5be9ac4a0ab65`. Its license notice declares
  GTNH modifications LGPLv3-or-later and retains the original MIT notice (JJN, 2016).
  Source: [GTNEIOrePlugin](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/GTNEIOrePlugin/tree/2ccf8c43d8d25b10239f5bcc48e5be9ac4a0ab65).

Exact source paths, repository revisions, licenses, modifications and SHA-256 hashes for all
51 imported textures and their animation files are recorded in
[`docs/roadmap/eye-of-harmony-assets.json`](docs/roadmap/eye-of-harmony-assets.json).
The Modernity candidates matched the author's local `Modernity-GTNH-2026-09-07` files byte for byte.
Moon, Mars, Venus and Mercury Planet Block faces (24 PNGs, `eye_of_harmony/planet/<planet>_<face>.png`)
were added on 2026-10-07 from the same local Modernity-GTNH copy, `assets/gtneioreplugin/textures/blocks/`
`Mo_`, `Ma_`, `Ve_`, `Me_` + face, bytes unchanged (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0). Planetary program parameters (rocket
tiers, 18000 s x 1.4^tier, gas, chance, efficiency, special fluids) follow GT5-Unofficial
`tectech/recipe/EyeOfHarmonyRecipeStorage.java`/`EyeOfHarmonyRecipe.java` and `gtneioreplugin` (LGPL-3.0).
The Glacio Planet Block art is the GTNA author's own and is not part of these imports.
Repository license texts are bundled in `META-INF/licenses/eye_of_harmony/` inside the jar.
Attribution appears on the component tooltips through `GTNASources`.

The new overlays are staged for the later controller-rendering milestone and are not yet bound
to the existing controller. CTM atlases/configurations were not imported; block animations keep
original frame timing. These notes do not change the permission status of unrelated Modernity
assets listed elsewhere in this file.

Modernity source revision: [1b52340349b92a11676eefb149eaec3b934eafcf](https://github.com/ModernityGTNH/Modernity-GTNH/tree/1b52340349b92a11676eefb149eaec3b934eafcf); [license](https://github.com/ModernityGTNH/Modernity-GTNH/blob/1b52340349b92a11676eefb149eaec3b934eafcf/LICENSE.txt).

### Eye of Harmony structural stage (2026-10-04)

The existing 33³ geometry was checked against every cell of the same pinned GT5U controller;
`docs/roadmap/eye-of-harmony-structure-audit.json` records its source hash, symbol mapping and
coordinate conversion. The new GTNA matcher requires uniform field tiers per family and the
reference's five ports. GTCEu's finite ME buffers are distinguished from its stocking parts;
stocking, crafting buffers/proxies, dual and energy hatches are excluded from the structure.

Core material identities and liquid temperatures follow `gregtech/loaders/materials/MaterialsInit.java`
and `gregtech/common/GTProxy.java` in that revision. Seven materials are registered with explicit
future processing: SpaceTime, RawStarMatter, White/Black Dwarf Matter, Universium, Time and Space.
GTCEu's existing material icons/models are used in this stage; no additional external artwork
was imported. GTNH's special material renderers and private-font galaxy glyph are not ported.
New fabrication recipes are deferred at the author's request. The controller still runs its
previous cosmos simulation until the planetary-operation stage; structural tier reading alone
does not establish operational parity.

### Eye of Harmony presentation and Nexus Terminal (2026-10-04)

The controller now binds the previously attributed inactive/active Eye of Harmony images as
front overlays; the copies and their origin are recorded in `eye-of-harmony-assets.json`.
The renderer reuses the existing attributed GTNA/GTO model assets with corrected transforms
and planetary-cycle state; no additional external artwork was imported in this stage.

Nexus Terminal's three-panel settings/category/tier workflow was studied from GTO's installed
`gtocore-forge-1.20.1-26.9.5.jar` (`com.gtolib.gtm.AdvancedTerminalBehavior`) and GTOCore's
`common/block/BlockMap.java` at revision `dc4824d`. Its native uipro implementation is not
imported: GTNA implements the interface using GTCEu 7.5.3/LDLib widgets and its own persisted
settings and pattern builder. The purple/black theme is retained.

### Eye of Harmony casing binding correction (2026-10-04)

The initial import mistakenly associated the casings with unrelated `BlockGTCasingsTT`
textures. The corrected bindings follow `tectech/thing/casing/BlockGTCasingsBA0.java` in
the same pinned GT5-Unofficial revision: metadata 10 (Temporal) uses
`EM_INNER_SPACETIME_REINFORCED_EOH_CASING`, metadata 11 (Spatial) uses
`EM_OUTER_SPACETIME_REINFORCED_EOH_CASING`, and metadata 12 (Boundary) uses
`EM_POWER_INFINITE`. The three unmodified upstream PNGs replace the initial files;
there are no matching candidates in the inspected local Modernity resource pack.
LGPL-3.0 source paths and new file hashes are recorded in the assets manifest.

### Eye of Harmony native EMI integration (2026-10-04)

The new recipe viewer uses EMI's published Forge API 1.1.13 for Minecraft 1.20.1
(`maven.modrinth:emi:1.1.13+1.20.1+forge`), as an optional compile dependency, not bundled
inside GTNA. Widget/API contracts were checked against its official source artifact.
The catalog, presentation and pagination are GTNA implementations; no external UI art
was imported. JEI and EMI share the same planetary catalog and information renderer.
The Terminal Battery selector follows GTOCore BlockMap's PSS_BATTERIES catalog,
using GTCEu 7.5.3 registered capacitor blocks instead of a name-based block search.

### Eye of Harmony viewer QA references (2026-10-05)

GTLCore `gtl-1431-skyblock`, local commit `18c7814`, was inspected for its separate
Cosmos Simulation item/fluid capacities and independent multiblock preview widget.
No GTLCore source or artwork was copied for these viewer changes. The optional
EOH-only EMI screen sizing hook was written for EMI 1.1.13 using its published source
contracts. The author requested plasma outputs of eight million buckets; this is a
GTNA quantity adaptation, not a claim of unchanged GTNH output units or balance.

### GTNA energy rebalance (G-0167)

At the author's request, Eye of Harmony startup scaling now uses `(circuit+1)^2`
instead of the GTNH `4^circuit` formula. Artificial Star's four fuel recipes generate
16 times their previously ported EU/t. These are GTNA balance adaptations; upstream
source attribution remains intact. No upstream code or assets were newly copied.

### GTLAdditions network terminals (G-0169)

Behavior adapted from local GTLAdditions master commit
`8caff5e93a5e65914d10dd176d48d66e7ec8c329` (GTLAdditions 3.2.8Custom-fix2):
`common/machine/multiblock/part/WirelessEnergyNetworkTerminalPartMachineBase.kt`,
`WirelessEnergyNetworkTerminalPartMachine.kt`, `common/machine/trait/NetworkEnergyContainer.kt`
and registration in `common/machine/GTLAddMachines.kt`. Adapted Java implementation:
`NexusNetworkTerminalPartMachine.java` and `NexusNetworkEnergyContainer.java`, under
GPL-3.0-only; bundled upstream license `META-INF/licenses/gtladditions/GPL-3.0.txt`.
The upstream LICENSE is GPL-3.0 while gradle.properties declares LGPLv3.0: these
adapted files retain the explicit LICENSE terms, without claiming special permission.
GTLCore-specific code, machine families and assets were not imported.
Models use existing GTNA/GTO overlays and GTCEu voltage casing assets with existing
attribution. Recipes use GTNA/GTCEu ingredients instead of unavailable GTL/KubeJS items.
GTNA-specific changes include Nexus matrix capacity/dimension/loss, simulation quotes,
BigInteger-safe sums, correct one-amp metadata and aggregate nominal voltage budgeting.
Source attribution is included in GTNASources and in-game tooltips.

### GTLAdditions terminal visual assets (G-0170)

At the author's request, terminal casing and animated overlay now use the GTLAdditions
assets at commit `8caff5e93a5e65914d10dd176d48d66e7ec8c329`: `wireless_terminate_casing.png`
and `wireless_energy_network_terminal.png`, their animation metadata, and the terminal
front-overlay model. PNGs/animation metadata are copied unchanged; the model namespace
is changed to gtna and a base cube/overlay offset is added for GTCEu 7.5.3.
Source/destination hashes and adaptations: `docs/roadmap/gtladditions-wireless-assets.json`.
Retain upstream LICENSE GPL-3.0 terms (bundled in META-INF/licenses/gtladditions);
metadata LGPL discrepancy remains documented. No special permission is claimed.

### Eye of Harmony / Forge of Gods material sprites (2026-10-07)

- The item and material-block PNGs under `assets/gtceu/textures/{item,block}/material_sets/`
  for SpaceTime, Universium, White Dwarf Matter, MHDCSM, Magmatter, Graviton Shard,
  Infinity and Eternity were copied from the author's local Modernity-GTNH pack, whose
  source revision is `1b52340349b92a11676eefb149eaec3b934eafcf` and whose art is
  **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**. The filenames were mapped from GTNH material icon names to GTCEu
  names. Animation metadata was preserved. Corresponding GTCEu models and transparent
  secondary layers were generated locally. Infinity and Eternity are prepared texture
  sets; no GTNA material registration is claimed for them.
- Black Dwarf Matter item sprites and its block sprite came from GTOCore revision
  `dc4824d1608ffad3bb0e2d53a2a068a739da3e84`, from its
  `black_dwarf_mtter` set. These are **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** GTO assets, renamed to
  `black_dwarf_matter` for GTNA. GTO has no corresponding frame or dense-plate sprite;
  those forms use the GTCEu parent set.
- The new EOH construction recipes are a GTNA adaptation using GTCEu components.
  They do not reproduce GTNH's BEC material, nanite or condensate requirements.

### ME Export Buffer and Nexus Structure Terminal (GTNA code on GTCEu)

`GTNAMEExportBufferPartMachine` (one part that is item bus and fluid hatch, outputs flushed to ME) is
written on GTCEu's LGPL-3.0 `MEOutputBusPartMachine`/`MEOutputHatchPartMachine`, `DualHatchPartMachine`
and `KeyStorage`, with long fluid amounts. The overlay is GTCEu's `block/overlay/appeng/me_output_bus`.

`NexusBlockPattern` (the terminal's auto-builder) was rewritten on 2026-10-10 as GTNA code on top of
GTCEu's `BlockPattern` (LGPL-3.0). It keeps GTCEu's pattern-to-world transform and hatch-limit order so
built structures pass GTCEu's own check. The previous version, based on third-party code without a
declared license, was removed, and GTNA no longer uses any code or assets from that project.

### Planet ore veins (GTOCore `GTOOres`, LGPL-3.0)

`GTNAPlanetOres` ports the 33 GTOCore vein definitions that include the Moon, Mars, Venus, Mercury or Glacio
(clusters, densities, weights, heights, layers and indicators), translated to the GTCEu 7.5.3 builder API and
restricted to those five Ad Astra planets. GTO-only veins (Celestine, Desh, Calorite, Ostrum, Zircon) were not
ported. Ore blocks use Ad Astra's own stone textures as base (`ad_astra:block/<planet>_stone`), referenced, not
copied.

### Advanced Fusion Reactor (GTOCore, LGPL-3.0 code / CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 assets)

`AdvancedFusionReactorMachine` and `GTNAAdvancedFusion` port GTOCore's `luv_kuangbiao_one_giant_nuclear_fusion_reactor`
(`AdvancedFusionReactorMachine`, `MultiBlockD`), with the structure files `pattern/kuangbiao1..5.mbs` and
`kuangbiao_crossrecipe.mbs` copied unchanged into `pattern/gto/`. Thirty-four GTOCore casing/coil/glass textures
(and their `.png.mcmeta`/`_bloom` layers) were copied from `assets/gtocore/textures/block/...` into
`assets/gtna/textures/block/casings/`, bytes unchanged. GTO materials Platinum-Manganese-Antimony Heusler Alloy and
Odyssey Nano Superalloy are re-registered in GTNA (Odyssey without GTO's nano-scale components). Recipes are
GTO's where every input exists, otherwise adapted (documented in `GTNAAdvancedFusionRecipes`).

### Dimensionally Transcendent Plasma Forge (GTNH GT5-Unofficial, LGPL-3.0)

`PlasmaForgeMachine`/`GTNAPlasmaForge` port GT5-Unofficial `MTEPlasmaForge` (structure converted by
`tools/convert_dtpf_structure.py` into `pattern/dtpf_gtnh.mbs`, catalyst discount and decay rules). Recipes follow
`PlasmaForgeRecipes`/`ResearchStationAssemblyLine` with documented substitutions. Textures: Dimensional Bridge Casing
from GTOCore (`dimensional_bridge_casing*`, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), Eternal coil (`MACHINE_COIL_ETERNAL*`) and Special Laser
Lens (`miscutils/.../MU-metaitem.01/105.png`) from the local Modernity-GTNH copy (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0); `.mcmeta`
connection paths rewritten to the GTNA namespace, pixels unchanged.


### Transcendent Plasma Mixer (GTNH GT5-Unofficial, LGPL-3.0)

`TranscendentPlasmaMixerMachine`/`GTNATranscendentPlasmaMixer` port GT5-Unofficial `MTETranscendentPlasmaMixer`
(structure strings, wireless cost rule `EU multiplier × EU/t × duration`). Recipes follow
`TranscendentPlasmaMixerRecipes` and GoodGenerator/GT5U Mellion, Orundum, Atomic Separation Catalyst and Harmonic
Compound recipes, with documented substitutions. Harmonic Compound texture: see the Nano Forge section.

### Nano Forge and nanites (GTNH GT5-Unofficial, LGPL-3.0; Modernity-GTNH, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)

`NanoForgeMachine`/`GTNANanoForge` port GT5-Unofficial `MTENanoForge` (pieces converted by
`tools/convert_nano_forge_structure.py`) and `NaniteChain` recipes with documented substitutions. Textures: Radiant
Naquadah Alloy Casing (`MACHINE_CASING_RADIANT_NAQUADAH_ALLOY*`) and nanites (`materialicons/NANITES`, `CUSTOM/*`,
taken from Modernity-GTNH when present, otherwise GT5-Unofficial), Phononic Seed Crystal (Modernity
`gt.metaitem.03/761.png`) and Harmonic Compound (GT5-Unofficial `gt.metaitem.03/762.png`); `.mcmeta` connection paths
rewritten to the GTNA namespace, pixels unchanged.

### Forge of Gods components (GTNH GT5-Unofficial, LGPL-3.0; Modernity-GTNH, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)

`GTNAGodforgeComponents`, the Cosmic Fabric Manipulator / Force Field Glass / Field Restriction Coil blocks and the
rewritten `GTNAGodforgeProgression` follow GT5-Unofficial `ResearchStationAssemblyLine.addGodforgeRecipes`,
`Godforge.java`, `AssemblerRecipes`, GT++ `RecipesGregTech` / `RecipeLoaderChemicalSkips` and GoodGenerator
`RecipeLoader`. Textures: `gt.metaitem.01/{349,415,428}`, `gt.metaitem.03/{759,760}`, `gt.neutroniumHeatCapacitor`,
`gt.1080k_Space_Coolantcell`, `gt.metaitem.01/{609,594,145,146}/8`, `qft/CosmicFabricManipulator`, `qft/ForceFieldGlass*` (Modernity-GTNH) and
`gt.metaitem.03/303`, `MU-metaitem.01/110`, `FRF_Coils/3` (GT5-Unofficial); pixels unchanged.

### Universium item visuals restored (2026-10-10)

Universium item silhouettes and overlays are copied from the local Modernity-GTNH
`assets/gregtech/textures/items/materialicons/CUSTOM/universium/` directory,
under the Modernity-GTNH CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 attribution documented above. Existing GTCEu
model aliases retain these original sprites; the extra singularity form uses the original
gem silhouette. Per-form cosmic masks are derived from the silhouette alpha channel.
The live star field is drawn by GTNA's own `gtna:item_effect` shader (see "Item effects"
below); it is not a claim of byte-identical GTNH/GTO/GTL shader behavior. Other permission
requests recorded in this document remain pending.

### Item effects (2026-10-14)

The `gtna:halo`, `gtna:glow_edge`, `gtna:cosmic`, `gtna:eternal` and `gtna:unstable` item
model loaders, the `gtna:item_effect` shader and the `gtna:item/effect/halo*` textures are
original GTNA work. They replace the earlier optional use of RenderBlender (LGPL-3.0): no
RenderBlender code, shader or texture is copied or bundled, and the former copy of its cosmic
fragment shader (`universium_cosmic.fsh`) was removed. The loaders keep RenderBlender's JSON
field names (`color`, `size`, `pulse`, `width`, `mask`) so existing models only change the
loader namespace.

### Eternity textures from Modernity-GTNH (2026-10-15)

At the author's request the `gtna_eternity` material set uses Modernity-GTNH's animated Eternity icons
(`gregtech/textures/items/materialicons/CUSTOM/eternity/*`, `blocks/iconsets/BLOCK_ETERNITY`,
`blocks/fluids/fluid.molten.eternity`), copied unchanged and renamed to GTCEu prefixes. Licence as in the
Modernity row of the table above (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0); the permission request listed there is still pending.

### RenderBlender cosmic shader and item effect behaviour (2026-10-15)

At the author's request the item effects again follow RenderBlender 1.1.1 (committee.nova.mods.renderblender,
LGPL-3.0, the same licence as GTNA): `assets/gtna/shaders/core/rb_cosmic.{vsh,fsh}` and
`assets/gtna/textures/misc/cosmic_0..9.png` are copied unchanged from it (the star-field shader originally from
Avaritia), and `CosmicShader`, the halo quad, the pulse jitter and the glow-edge copy in `ItemEffectRenderer` are
ported from its `CosmicBakeModel`, `HaloBakedModel` and `GlowEdgeBakedModel`. The eternal and unstable effects stay
GTNA's own `gtna:item_effect` shader.

## Multiblock tooltip adaptation (2026-10-10)

The multiblock tooltip facts are adapted from the original controller tooltips and translations
of GTOCore (`dc4824d`), GTNL (`52345d2`), GTLCore (`18c7814`), TST (`ceaa462`), GTCEu
(`v7.5.3-1.20.1`), GTLsupb (`2.6.4`), and the GTNH controllers/documentation pinned above
(`a3e1e11241a814c9fa0dd0973d5699548428f689`). Wording and values are adapted to the GTNA
tooltip format and implemented behavior. Each machine retains its in-game `GTNASources` credit.
The existing source notices and license terms above continue to apply; this revision imports no
controller implementation. See `docs/reports/multiblock-tooltips-technical-details.md`.

## Simplified Chinese translation (zh_cn)

`assets/gtna/lang/zh_cn.json` was written for GTNA. Where an English string is identical to one in the official Simplified
Chinese translations of GregTech CEu Modern (LGPL-3.0), GTOCore (GTO, with permission), GTLCore (LGPL-3.0) or GregTech:
New Horizons (GT5-Unofficial, LGPL-3.0), that translation is reused so players see the terms they already know.
