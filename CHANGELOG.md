# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Item effects (RenderBlender no longer needed)
- GTNA now draws its own item effects: `gtna:halo`, `gtna:glow_edge`, `gtna:cosmic`, `gtna:eternal` and `gtna:unstable` model loaders, with a new procedural shader and new halo textures. RenderBlender is no longer used.
- Fixes material icons (ingots, plates, dusts, gears, wires, gems of 56 GTNA material sets) showing as missing textures when RenderBlender was not installed (0.5.4–0.5.5). Icons now always render; the effect is drawn on top.
- KubeJS: `GTNAClientEvents.itemEffects` (client scripts) adds, replaces or removes effects per item or per GTCEu material. Example in `examples/kubejs/client_scripts/gtna_item_effects.js`.
- Client config: toggle halos, glow edges and shader effects, and set the animation speed.

### New multiblocks (GTO)
- **Large Incubator**: Incubator with Parallel Hatch; the glass tier caps the voltage tier, and the cleanroom filters set the filter tier a recipe may ask for (`filter_casing` recipe data: 1 plain, 2 sterile).
- **Kerr-Newman Homogenizer**: Mixer running several recipes at once (Thread Hatch), Parallel and laser hatches.
- **Nyarlathotep's Tentacle**: Assembly Line running several recipes at once with coil parallel and an Optical Data Reception Hatch.
- **Giant Sintering Array** (new `gtna:sintering_furnace` type): coil temperature gate, parallel `4^glass tier`.
- **Integrated Vapor Deposition System** (new `gtna:chemical_vapor_deposition` and `gtna:physical_vapor_deposition` types): several recipes at once, parallel `4^glass tier`.
- **Reaction Furnace** (new `gtna:reaction_furnace` type): coil furnace like the Electric Blast Furnace, with an upgrade module that unlocks the Parallel and Accelerate hatches.
- **Dyson Sphere Launch Silo** and **Receiving Station** (new `gtna:dyson_sphere` type, Dyson Swarm Module item): the silo puts swarm modules in orbit of its planet, the station turns them into laser power, needing computation and liquid helium; the swarm takes damage over time.

- **Space Elevator** with the **Assembler Module** and **Resource Collection Module** (new `gtna:assembler_module`, `gtna:miner_module` and `gtna:drilling_module` types; Nanotube Spool and Space Drones MK I–VI): above ZPM, with computation and 256 Nanotube Spools, the elevator powers up to twelve modules; the Power Module MK (I–V) sets their parallel `4^(MK - 1)` and which Assembler Module recipes they may run. The Resource Collection Module mines 20 asteroid ore mixes and collects 11 gases with drones and rocket fuel.

### Bose-Einstein Condensate (GTNH)
- **Five multiblocks** on a physical condensate network: the **Entanglement Apparatus** turns molten metals and fluids into 19 kinds of **entangled condensate**; the **Containment Field** stores it (field strength = capacity and EU/t, voided on power loss); the **Maxwell Gate** lets it flow one way, with filters; the **Observation Array** feeds nanites, EU and condensate to its **Teleportation Nodes**, which craft the **Condensate Assembly** recipes step by step, one nanite tier per item slot.
- **Bose-Einstein Condensate Conduit** (dye it to split networks) and its casing; **BEC Hatch**, **Nanite Containment Bus**, **Line-Of-Sight Connector Hatch** (with the beam), **Nanite Tier Detector**, **Condensate Detector** and **Teleportation Node Controller** hatches; the BEC casings; 28 **metamaterials** and the **Transdimensional Alignment Matrix**.
- Every GTNH BEC recipe whose output exists in GTNA, including the BEC casings and the Godforge and Eye of Harmony parts. The Singularity Shielding Casing and the Medial and Central Graviton Flow Modulators now come only from the BEC, as in GTNH; their temporary assembly-line recipes are gone.
- New materials: **Bedrockium**, **Tairitsu**, **Inactive** and **Boundless Cosmic Solder**.

### Nano Forge
- **Tier 4**: the MagMatter extension (GTNH structure with its own casings) and MagMatter Nanites. With a nanite equal to the recipe's output in an input bus, the forge drains all molten MagMatter from its hatches for extra parallel and a shorter duration, as in GTNH.

### Other
- **Tiered glass**: any of 13 glasses (Tempered, MV, through Cosmic Neutronium Borosilicate, MAX) in structures that read a glass tier; all glass of one structure must match. Six GTO borosilicate glasses added (Titanium, Tritanium, Enderium, Quarks, Draconium, Cosmic Neutronium).
- New GTO casings: Shielded Accelerator, Bioactive Mechanical Casing, Advanced Fusion Coil, UHV Accelerator Electromagnetic Coil, Uruium Coil Block, Spacetime Assembly Line Casing, Quark Pipe, Space Elevator Internal Support and Support, Space Elevator Power Modules MK I–V, Dyson Deployment Magnet, Core and Casing.
- Recipe types left empty where GTO's recipes need GTO-only materials (sintering, vapor deposition, reaction furnace); packs add their own through KubeJS.
- GTO's Dimensional Bridge Casing is GTNA's Spatial Casing (the old `dimensional_bridge_casing` id already migrates to it).
- Not ported: GTO's Radiation Hatch (Large Incubator), Suprachronal and Circuit Assembly Line modes (Nyarlathotep), the Kerr-Newman black-hole effect (closed GTOLib), the Machine Access Link.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-10-11

### Fixed
- Crash on launch with JEI 15.32 and newer: `client.UniversiumJeiFluidMixin` targeted the old `FluidTankRenderer.drawTiledSprite` signature (JEI 15.32 added a `TilingDirection` parameter). There is now one injection per signature, each with its exact descriptor and optional, so the Universium fluid overlay works with any JEI 15.x. GTNA now builds against JEI 15.62.0.219.
- The same safeguard for the other viewer-dependent injections: the Eye of Harmony tab sizing in EMI (`setPage`) and the stale-slot guard of GTCEu's JEI multiblock pages.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-10-11

### Changed
- Brazilian Portuguese (pt_br) translation completed: the 313 keys that were still missing (pattern buffer, structure checks, overclock and accelerate hatches, terminal, research, materials, multi-plates and creative tabs) are now translated.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-10-11

### Faster previews of huge multiblocks

- The cached scene of LDLib (EMI/JEI multiblock previews and structure GUIs) is now compiled off-thread in batches of 4,096 blocks, each in its own vertex buffer, and drawn as batches finish. Very large structures no longer overflow a single buffer or stall until the whole structure is built. Technique from GTLCore (LGPL-3.0).

### Other

- New `researchTree` gameplay option (default on): turning it off removes the research tree key, screen and commands, for packs without research nodes.
- Simplified Chinese (zh_cn) translation.

### Debug parts for testing (creative only, no recipes)

- **Debug Energy Hatch** and **Debug Laser Target Hatch**: always full. Their GUI works like the GTCEu creative energy
  container (and the GTMThings creative hatches): tier selector, free voltage field, amperage with -/+ buttons and an
  on/off switch. The laser hatch starts at 4096 A. Any change re-forms the multiblock at once.
- **Debug Input Bus** and **Debug Input Hatch**: mark items or fluids in their 3x3 ghost slots; recipes get endless
  amounts and nothing is consumed. Both keep the circuit slot.
- **Debug Energy Cover**: keeps the energy buffer of any GregTech machine full.
- All of them can be turned off with the `debugParts` hatch toggle in the config.

### ME Export Buffer

- The GUI now shows 9 item rows and 9 fluid rows side by side (it showed 3 of each). The buffer itself already held
  any number of item and fluid types.

### ⚠️ Personal Space moved to ModernSpace

- **Personal Space is no longer part of GTNA.** It now lives in its own mod, **ModernSpace**. GTNA no longer depends
  on **Infiniverse**.
- **Keep your personal dimensions:** install ModernSpace (0.3.1 or later) together with this GTNA version. The first time an old world
  opens, ModernSpace imports it automatically: dimensions, settings, portals, players inside a personal dimension and
  portal items. The files it changes are backed up with a `.modernspace_backup` suffix.
- Without ModernSpace, old portals disappear and the personal dimensions stop loading. Their folders stay in the save.

### New multiblocks (ported from GTOCore)

- **Processing:** High Energy Laser Lathe, Extreme Compressor, Gemini Containment System (packer), Giant
  Electrochemical Workstation, Heavy Rolling (bender), Hand of Arachne (loom), Desulfurizer (with an optional extension
  structure), Rare Earth Centrifugal, Lightning Rod (arc generator), PCB Factory (three structure tiers, chosen with a
  screwdriver), Compound Extreme Cooling Unit (vacuum freezer, atomization and, on its larger structure, plasma
  condensing), Dimensional Focus Engraving Array, Star Ultimate Material Forge Factory and Space Probe Receiver (works
  only in space).
- **Plasma and power:** Hyperdimensional Plasma Fusion Core (runs Plasma Forge recipes in parallel), Hyper Reactor and
  Advanced Hyper Reactor (booster plasmas set per recipe), Fuel Cell Generator (absorption, transfer and release modes
  with membrane electrodes and redox-flow electrolytes).
- **Research:** Supercomputing Center (three tiers: HPCA, NICH and GWCA components, MFPC coolant in the new Thermal
  Conductor Hatch), Data Center and Analysis & Research Center.
- New recipe types, casings, glasses, materials and parts that come with them. Some GTOCore recipe types ship empty
  (or with only the recipes whose ingredients exist outside GTOCore) so modpacks can fill them.
- A new check makes sure every recipe type, block and item has an English and Portuguese name and a model.

### Multiblock tooltips

- Every GTNA multiblock now uses the same tooltip layout: machine type, a flavor line, a short description and
  colored bullet lines for bonuses, numbers and restrictions, followed by the source addon.
- Several tooltip numbers were wrong and now match the machines (Large Steam Circuit Assembler parallel, Large Steam
  Centrifuge, Thermal Centrifuge and Alloy Smelter speed, Steam Elevator Apiary and Beacon modules).

### Batteries

- The Really, Extremely, Insanely and Mega Ultimate Batteries are now rechargeable batteries (UEV, UIV, UXV and OpV),
  tagged `gtceu:batteries/<tier>`.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-10-07

Big endgame update. Changes below are relative to 0.5.1.

### ⚠️ Dependencies

- **New required dependency: [Infiniverse](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/infiniverse) 1.0.0.5 or newer** (used by Personal Space dimensions). It is not bundled; install it alongside GTNA.
- Optional: **Ad Astra** (planet ores, planet simulations in the Eye of Harmony, planet dimension icons) and **SGJourney**.
- Tested with GTCEu 7.5.3.

### New multiblocks

- **Forge of Gods** (GTNH): controller with ring sub-structures, upgrade tree, milestones, fuel and battery, cosmetics, star and beam rendering, and the **Smelting, Molten, Plasma and Exotic** modules. The Plasma Module now also covers the GT++ metals (Celestial Tungsten, Astral Titanium, Hypogen, Rhugnor, Six-Phased Copper…).
- **Dimensionally Transcendent Plasma Forge** (GTNH): coil heat, EBF-style overclock and the catalyst discount after long continuous runs.
- **Transcendent Plasma Mixer** (GTNH): powered only by the owner's wireless network; the full cost is paid when a recipe starts.
- **Nano Forge** tiers 1–3 (GTNH) with 11 nanites. The tier nanite goes in an input bus (GTCEu controllers have no slot).
- **Advanced Fusion Reactor** (GTO) with four tier extensions and an overclock extension. It replaces GTNH Fusion Mk4/Mk5.
- **ME Export Buffer** (GTMThings style).

### Eye of Harmony

- **Planet simulations:** Nether, End and, with Ad Astra, Moon, Mars, Venus, Mercury and Glacio, each with its own Planet Block, rocket tier and ore catalogue.
- **KubeJS support** for adding and editing simulation programs.
- **Recipe viewers:** reworked JEI page that matches the EMI layout (separate item and fluid grids, one page per simulation, the window grows to fit).
- **Recipes:** controller, casings and field generators now use fluids, as in GTNH.

### Content

- **Forge of Gods material chain** ported from GTNH: Creon, Mellion, Transcendent Metal, Six-Phased Copper, Hypogen, Rhugnor, Phonon Medium, Tengam, UIV/UMV superconductors, Infinity, Eternity, Shirabon, Dimensionally Shifted Superfluid, the Excited catalysts and more, with default recipes.
- **GTNH Forge of Gods components:** Stable Boson Containment Unit, heat capacitors, Thermal Superconductor, Tengam Electromagnet, Graviton Anomaly, Cosmic Fabric Manipulator, Force Field Glass, Field Restriction Coil, Raw Tesseract, ZPM3–ZPM6 batteries. The Forge of Gods progression and upgrade costs now follow GTNH.
- **New circuits:** Optical (UV–UIV) and Exotic (UHV–UXV) circuit families. OpV/MAX circuits are left to modpacks.
- **Recipes GTCEu lacks:** default recipes for UHV–OpV components (motors, pistons, pumps, conveyors, robot arms, emitters, sensors, field generators), UEV–MAX machine casings and energy hatches, and UU Matter. All of them can be replaced with KubeJS.
- **Ad Astra planets:** ore veins, and proper dimension icons in GTCEu dimension conditions (World Data Scanner, ore veins).
- **Hatches:** high-tier module hatches and wireless hatch recipes.
- **Restricted parts:** recipes for the output-boost and infinite-input parts. They only act on recipes of their own tier.
- **Flotation line:** the full reagent chain (carbon disulfide, ethylates, xanthates, turpentine).
- **Removed:** Matrix Modules I–IV and the Nexus Hypercore Casing.

### Personal Space

- Port of the GTNH PersonalSpace dimensions:
  - configurable worldgen and sky;
  - editor GUI;
  - portal and portal book;
  - `/pspace` commands.
- The portal now appears in the creative tab and has an LV recipe made with normal obsidian.

### GTO machinery and balance

- **GTO machines:** Blaze Blast Furnace, Cold Ice Freezer, Chemical Plant, Mega Alloy Blast Smelter, ISA Mill, Rocket and Supercritical turbines, Industrial Flotation Cell, Vacuum Drying Furnace, Component Assembler and Component Assembly Line.
- **Dehydrator family:** full LV–OpV set.
- **Wireless:** energy HUD overlay.
- **Balance profiles:** configurable profiles for the Universal Factory, Nexus wireless loss and ME Pattern Buffer capacity.

### Fixes

- **Missing names:** item and block names no longer disappear (two language generators were overwriting each other).
- **Material textures:** icon sets for Hypogen, Chromatic Glass, Dragonblood and Black Dwarf Matter, plus extra plate forms for the custom sets.
- **Fluid textures:** original textures for Infinity, Eternity, Hypogen, Chromatic Glass, Rhugnor, Dragonblood, Primordial Matter, the Phonon fluids and Stable Baryonic Matter. Fluids with no texture get their own colour instead of white.
- **Item textures:** glowstone nanite animation fixed; ZPM4–ZPM6 batteries are now tinted per tier.
- **Tooltips:** the new multiblocks use the standard tooltip format with source attribution.
- **Nano Forge:** tier 2 and 3 extensions now use the Assembly Line Casing, as in GTNH.
- **ME Pattern Buffer:** upgrades no longer spill stored patterns or render invisibly.
- **Dead-end recipes:** several were found and fixed by a new recipe reachability check.

### Known limitations

- **Bose-Einstein Condensate machines** are not ported yet. Until then, the Singularity Shielding Casing and the Medial/Central Graviton Flow Modulators use provisional Assembly Line recipes, and the DTPF's Transdimensional Alignment Matrix / Convergence is unavailable.
- **Nano Forge tier 4** is not ported yet.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-25

### Corrected JAR
- Fixed production startup crashes in the GTCEu module-tooltip and AE2 crafting-confirmation
  mixins. Both now recognize the Minecraft 1.20.1 runtime method names, and missing injection
  targets cannot stop the game from loading.
- Reduced repeated structure checks while the Nexus Terminal builds the Nexus ME Hypercore.
  The target structure is checked once at the end of the build. The in-world build time still
  needs confirmation with the corrected JAR.
- Re-tested startup in a Prism Launcher instance with GTCEu 7.5.3, AE2 15.4.10 and KubeJS
  `2001.6.5-build.26`. The full validation gate passed with 60/60 GameTests.

### Added
- Ported four GTOCore multiblocks: Generator Array, Fishing Ground, Evaporation Plant and
  Greenhouse, with their structures, recipes, casings and English/Portuguese tooltips. The
  Evaporation Plant also has its titanium auxiliary tower.
- Generator Array supports its eligible GTCEu generators and can send power to the Nexus Flux
  Matrix in wireless mode. Fishing Ground includes its bait, water and circuit based catches.
- Added automated formation, recipe, tooltip and behavior checks for the new machines.

### Changed
- Removed Nexus Flux Matrix Safe Mode. Valid energy withdrawals can drain the network to zero;
  old SafeMode save data is ignored and no longer written.
- Wireless Steam Hatches now declare steam specific abilities only. They no longer fill general
  fluid hatch slots in electric multiblocks.
- Clarified Evaporation Plant hatch placement: one fluid input and one or two energy inputs go in
  the base; fluid outputs go in the tower stages. Fluid hatch tier is unrestricted.

### Fixed
- Prevented a startup crash with KubeJS `2001.6.5-build.26` caused by the GTNA DataGenerator
  mixin targeting a missing method name. The injection is now optional and handles the runtime
  method name used by Minecraft 1.20.1.
- Greenhouse sunlight detection now responds to an opaque roof cover and recovers when it is
  removed.
- Revised the four ported machines' tooltips to remove duplicate descriptions and preserve
  source attribution and relevant mechanics in both supported languages.

### Validation
- Passed the full formatting, compilation, unit test, GameTest server and data generation gate.
  The GameTest suite passed all 60 required tests, including a MAX fluid output hatch in a valid
  Evaporation Plant tower stage.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-25

This release expands steam and ore processing, adds multiblock modules and strengthens AE2
autocrafting. It also includes the Structure Terminal improvements, ME Pattern Buffer fixes,
tooltips and automated tests recorded in the continuity ledger.

### Added
- **Electric Blast Furnace module**: a GTNA sub-pattern registered for `gtceu:electric_blast_furnace`
  that adds Parallel / Overclock / Accelerate / Thread hatches to the furnace.
- **KubeJS support for sub-patterns**: the `GTNAServerEvents.subPatterns` server event lets modpack
  creators add module/extension structures to any multiblock (new or existing), unlocking new
  abilities (see `docs/roadmap/sub-patterns.md`).
- **Sub-pattern (module/extension) mechanic** (`ISubPatternMachine` + a `MultiblockControllerMachine`
  mixin): a multiblock can be extended by additional structures attached to the same controller, whose
  parts are merged in to unlock new abilities (e.g. Parallel / Accelerate hatches). Ported in the
  spirit of GTOCore's `addSubPattern`.
- **Liquefaction Furnace** (GTOCore port, LGPLv3): a coil multiblock that melts an item into a fluid,
  with a stainless-steel extension tower as its sub-pattern.
- **Thermal Power Pump** (GTOCore port, LGPLv3): a primitive no-energy multiblock that condenses
  steam into water at a biome-dependent rate (rain +50%; the Nether produces nothing).
- **Brick Kiln** (GTOCore port, LGPLv3): a primitive no-energy multiblock that fires bricks and
  ceramics from compressed clay + coal (parallel 4), closing the ULV era.
- **Integrated Ore Processor** (GTLCore port, LGPLv3): the 6×12×11 stainless/HSSE multiblock that
  collapses the macerate → wash → thermal/sift/centrifuge chain into one recipe per circuit.
- **Advanced Integrated Ore Processor** (GTLCore/TST port, LGPLv3): the 32×12×15 laser-powered,
  effectively unlimited-parallel endgame version.
- **Faithful integrated ore processing recipes**: one recipe per circuit 1..7 for both raw ore and
  stone ore, with the real per-stage byproducts, the material's own washing fluid (distilled water,
  mercury, sodium persulfate, ...) and GTLCore's durations/EUt. The multiplier is configurable
  (`gtna/balance/machines.json` → `integratedOreMultiplier`, default 4 = GTLCore parity).
- **Craft recipes** for the two new multiblocks: Assembler (EV) for the Integrated Ore Processor and
  Assembly Line (UHV) for the Advanced Integrated Ore Processor.

### Changed
- `gtna:ore_processing` now uses GTLCore's IO sizes (2 item in / 9 item out / 1 fluid in).
- **Steam Ore Processing Module**: no longer consumes lubricant; it consumes the washing fluid of the
  matching integrated recipe (circuit 1 needs none; 2/3/4 distilled water; 5/6/7 the ore's fluid).
  Its input filter now only accepts ore/crushed prefixes, not ingots.

### Fixed
- **Steam Ore Processing Module** returned the raw ore unchanged: the recipe lookup passed
  `Ingredient.of(stack)` to GT's recipe DB, which does not expand the item's tags, so tag-based ore
  recipes were never found. It now passes the `ItemStack` (like GT's own `SmartItemFilter`).
- **Addon logo** now shows in every GTNA multiblock UI: a client-only mixin on GTCEu's
  `FancyMachineUIWidget` covers the electric/no-energy/fancy-steam controllers, and the two custom
  310×270 UIs (Nexus ME Hypercore, Nexus Flux Matrix) got an explicit logo.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- **Universal Factory** (GTNA-native port of GTLsupb, LGPLv3): 32 recipe types, cross-recipe
  threads, warmup/overload/batch processing, and the new `universal_factory_casing`.
- **Primitive Stone Furnace** (GTLsupb port): zero-energy multiblock that smelts with effectively
  unlimited threads and parallel.
- **Thread Hatch** wiring: the Industrial Slaughterhouse and the Dimensionally Transcendent Dirt
  Forge are now on the multiple-recipes base and accept the Thread Hatch.
- **Source attribution in tooltips**: ported machines now show `Source: <addon>` (GTO, GTNL, TST,
  GTLsupb, GTOEPP), and `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` documents the license of every source.

### Changed
- **Accelerate Hatch**: penalty now uses the recipe's pre-overclock tier (GTO parity — a low-tier
  recipe in a high-tier machine is not punished), the amount is player-configurable, and the
  tooltips follow the GTO wording.
- **Overclock Hatch**: parity with GTOCore (`100 / (tier - 6) %`, configurable).
- **Industrial Slaughterhouse** migrated to `WorkableElectricMultipleRecipesMachine`.
- **Dimensionally Transcendent Dirt Forge** migrated to the multiple-recipes base as a zero-energy
  machine (`getMaxParallel()` = 524288, 1-tick duration).
- **Large Steam Solar Boiler** is the single solar boiler; the duplicate Mega Pressure Solar Boiler
  (class, config, balance, lang, docs and recipes) was removed and the Hyper Pressure Reactor recipe
  now uses the large one.
- Configurable amounts for the Accelerate/Overclock/Thread hatches, with GTO-style tooltips.

### Fixed
- **Output Boost** double application (M→M²) on the multiple-recipes base.
- **Pattern buffer** crashes: tier-index guard in `WorkableElectricMultipleRecipesMachine`
  display text, NPE guard in `PatternSlotResolver`, and scaled-input push in
  `ParallelPatternDetails`.
- **Dedicated server** crash: two client-only leaks in common code.
- **Jade** config translation crash for the pattern buffer provider.
- Nine config options that rendered as raw lang keys.
- Zero-energy parallel computation bypassing GT's `ParallelLogic.getMaxByInput`.

### QA
- GameTest harness plus structure/behaviour tests (16 gametests) and 12 unit tests, all gated in CI.
- `runData` determinism check in CI.

## [0.3.2-dev] - 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Nexus ME Hypercore / AE2 Integration**:
  - Added `Crafting CPU Interface` as the AE2 bridge part for the Nexus ME Hypercore multiblock.
  - Added AE2 virtual Crafting CPU cluster support for the Nexus ME Hypercore, including saved CPU state and relog recovery.
  - Added AE2 mixins for Nexus virtual CPU discovery, large CPU storage formatting, large co-processor formatting, and infinite-value display.
  - Added generated assets, lang entries, and item/model coverage for the Crafting CPU Interface and Infinite Cell Component.
  - Added the Nexus ME Hypercore structure file integration based on the GTOCore ME Computer Core style.
- **Primitive Distillation Tower**:
  - Added the primitive steam distillation tower controller with GT-Not-Leisure-inspired structure behavior.
  - Added MV-and-below recipe restriction and 75% steam consumption behavior.
  - Added tooltip text explaining the 6-fluid-output limit and steam efficiency.
- **Dimensionally Transcendent Steam Line**:
  - Added fixed two-thread processing support to the `Dimensionally Transcendent Steam Oven`, allowing two different furnace recipes to run at the same time.
  - Added clearer tooltips for the Dimensionally Transcendent steam machines, including threads, speed, parallelism, and structure notes.
- **Recipes and Progression**:
  - Added missing recipes for coordinate cards, additional pattern buffer tiers, and thread hatches through UHV.
  - Added generated models/assets for the new steam-era machines, casings, and the primitive spacetime distortion device item.
- **Eye of Wood**:
  - Added dedicated Eye of Wood structure data, renderer support, localization, and richer player-facing tooltip text based on the original Twist Space Technology behavior.

### Changed
- **Nexus ME Hypercore / AE2 Integration**:
  - Reworked the Nexus ME Hypercore structure predicates to accept only the required Crafting CPU Interface and Parallel Hatch where appropriate, removing Pattern Buffer acceptance.
  - Changed Nexus ME Hypercore casing/render texture from Magtech casing to GTCEu Nonconducting Casing.
  - Changed Nexus ME Hypercore module counting to use the formed multiblock pattern cache, fixing rotated or larger structure undercounting.
  - Updated Nexus ME Hypercore controller UI to use full labels while abbreviating only large numeric values.
  - Updated AE2 Crafting CPU list formatting so Nexus CPUs use compact storage and co-processor numbers.
  - Updated transcendent mode to expose infinite storage/co-processors to AE2 and render them with the infinity symbol in the AE2 terminal.
- **Primitive Distillation Tower**:
  - Reworked the structure to match the GT-Not-Leisure primitive tower layout: 3x3 steel firebox base, five hollow steel hull layers, and a closed steel hull top layer.
  - Fixed the multiblock preview so the tower renders upright instead of lying horizontally.
  - Restricted steam handling to normal steam input or wireless steam input and removed wireless steam output acceptance from the tower structure.
- **Large Steam Multiblocks**:
  - Fixed multiple controller facings that were turned inward, including Large Steam Lathe, Cutting Machine, Extractor, Forming Press, Hammer, and Ore Washer cases.
  - Fixed inverted or swapped structure blocks in several previews/patterns, including Large Steam Hammer and Large Steam Compressor glass/frame placement.
  - Replaced incorrect Solid Machine Casing requirements with Steam Machine Casing where appropriate.
  - Added or expanded Large Steam tooltips with speed, efficiency, parallel, and structure information.
- **Eye of Wood**:
  - Changed the structure requirement from Solid Machine Casing to Steam Machine Casing.
  - Fixed the controller overlay/render path that caused the controller to show as black/pink.
  - Expanded the tooltip to explain water/lava storage, success chance, 60-second runs, ore outputs, and steam venting on failure.
- **Primitive Man's SpaceTime Distortion Device**:
  - Reduced the item model scale without changing the multiblock render.
  - Switched the item texture to the requested `22.png` source texture.
- **Steam Solar Boilers**:
  - Adjusted the Mega Pressure Solar Boiler preview orientation to match the horizontal solar-boiler style better.
- **Custom Hatches**:
  - Changed Overclock Hatch behavior to modify the machine's overclock curve per 4x EU/t instead of acting as a final duration multiplier.
  - Kept Accelerate Hatch as a final post-overclock recipe duration reduction.
  - Updated Overclock Hatch and Accelerate Hatch tooltips to explain the difference clearly for players.

### Fixed
- Fixed Nexus Terminal startup/opening crashes caused by incompatible glass predicate handling in the Nexus ME Hypercore pattern.
- Fixed AE2 Crafting CPU screen crashes when Nexus Hypercore storage exceeded AE2's default byte unit formatting range.
- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore controller opening while formed by removing heavy module recalculation from UI creation and display refresh paths.
- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore T5 matrix module counting so full transcendent structures report `481/481`.
- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore transcendent state showing finite AE2 CPU values instead of the infinity symbol.
- Fixed Nexus ME Hypercore / Crafting CPU Interface disconnecting after relog by persisting CPU storage/co-processor values and reannouncing the virtual CPU after grid reload.
- Fixed a relog server crash where Nexus ME Hypercore sync tried to read the GTCEu multiblock cache before it had been rebuilt.
- Fixed missing or overly abbreviated Nexus ME Hypercore, Crafting CPU Interface, and Infinite Cell Component language entries.
- Fixed Primitive Distillation Tower preview/pattern registration issues that caused `Pattern formed checking failed: gtna:primitive_distillation_tower` during client startup.
- Fixed several Large Steam structures incorrectly accepting wireless steam output hatches where only normal outputs or steam inputs should be valid.
- Fixed missing or overly simple tooltip coverage for newly added steam multiblocks.
- Fixed GTCEu electric multiblocks using automatic abilities, such as the Electric Blast Furnace, not accepting GTNA Accelerate Hatches and Overclock Hatches.
- Fixed GTCEu standard electric multiblocks applying Overclock Hatch duration reduction even when no real energy overclock was available.

### Tested
- Ran `compileJava`, `runData`, and `jar reobfJar` after the Nexus ME Hypercore, AE2 CPU, lang, and generated asset changes.
- Confirmed the jar contains the Nexus ME Hypercore machine, Crafting CPU Interface part, AE2 Crafting Service mixin, AE2 Crafting CPU Cluster mixin, CPU Selection List mixin, and Tooltips mixin.
- Ran `compileJava`, `runData`, and `runClient` after the latest multiblock and hatch changes.
- Confirmed the client starts without a Primitive Distillation Tower pattern failure after the upright preview fix.
- Ran `compileJava` and `runData` after adding GTNA performance hatches to GTCEu automatic multiblock abilities.
- Ran `compileJava` after correcting Overclock Hatch scaling on GTCEu standard electric multiblocks.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-04-23

  - Added the `Eye of Wood` multiblock as a wood-and-bronze early proto-singularity machine.
  - Added dynamic water/lava-fed success logic with steam venting on failed rolls.
  - Added processed ore dust output bundles and an in-machine success chance display.
  - Added crafting recipe, config toggle, and runtime localization for the controller.
- **Steam Expansion Follow-up**:
  - Added `Large Steam Circuit Assembler`, `Large Steam Mixer`, `Large Steam Centrifuge`, `Large Steam Thermal Centrifuge`, `Large Steam Bath`, `Large Steam Storage Tank`, `Large Steam Solar Boiler`, `Dimensionally Transcendent Steam Boiler`, and `Dimensionally Transcendent Steam Oven`.

### Changed
- **Steam Controller Coverage**:

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Steam Logistics Expansion**:
  - Added `Wireless Steam Input Hatch` and `Wireless Steam Output Hatch` in bronze and steel variants.
  - Added `Huge Steam Input Bus` and `Huge Steam Output Bus` for higher-throughput steam multiblocks.
  - Added `Infinite Steam Input Bus` for creative and testing workflows.
  - Added `Output Boost Steam Output Bus` with tier-based output multiplication.
- **Infinity Covers**:
  - Added `Steam Infinity Cover` for feeding singleblock steam machines without a conventional boiler chain.
  - Added `Electric Infinity Cover` for singleblock electric machine testing and automation setups.
- **Nexus Machine Expansion**:
  - Added `Nexus Assembly Forge` multiblock.
  - Added pattern-aware internal batching and craft pattern hatch aggregation for the Nexus forge UI and processing flow.
  - Added `Nexus Structure Terminal` to support multiblock structure handling.
- **Large Steam Multiblocks**:
  - Added `Large Steam Hammer`.
  - Added `Large Steam Compressor`.
  - Added `Large Steam Extractor`.
  - Added `Large Steam Ore Washer`.
  - Reused reference-inspired multiblock layouts based on the addon structure files already bundled in the project.
  - Hooked controller models to GTCEu overlays to keep the new steam line visually aligned with the rest of the pack.

### Changed
- **Steam Progression**:
  - Expanded the early steam roster with stronger multiblock options aimed at reducing beginner grind while keeping steam-age identity.
  - Added adjustable parallel controls to the new `Large Steam` machines so throughput can be tuned in-machine.

  - Added machine crafting recipes for the new `Large Steam` controller blocks using the addon's hydraulic and precision steam component progression.
- **Nexus Forge UX**:
  - Improved the `Nexus Assembly Forge` display text to surface craft-pattern hatch count and loaded pattern totals directly on the machine.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Nexus Wireless Energy Network**: 
  - Automated player-binding for wireless hatches upon placement.
  - New shift-right-click unbind mechanic using the Nexus Linker.
  - Synchronized energy storage data between the controller UI and the Quantum Terminal.
  - Visual locator for network connections using a custom Tesselator-based rendering system (replacing Jad/Highlight dependency).

### Fixed
- Fixed data-gen failures on the Wireless Recipes by resolving Registry lookups directly from the `GTMachines` array values instead of strings.
- Added strict backpressure in `NexusEnergyNetwork` and output-hatches to prevent infinite internal buffering or voiding in filled networks. 
- Aligned energy capacity calculations to directly respect GTCEu tier formulas.
- Resolved localized plugin crashes in Jade tooltips (`en_us.json`).

### Changed
- Converted all specific hard-coded item ingredients in Wireless hatch crafting to TagPrefix representations (`circuit`, `cableGtHex`, `plate`).
